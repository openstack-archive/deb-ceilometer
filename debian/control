Description: ceilometer python libraries
 Ceilometer aims to deliver a unique point of contact for billing systems to 
 aquire all counters they need to establish customer billing, accross all
 current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must be
 tracable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support new
 projects, and agents doing data collections should be independent of the
 overall system.
