ceilometer (2013.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty of few folders owned by nova after purge.
    Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for reporting (Closes: #709876).
  * Ran wrap-and-sort to clean debian/control.
  * Replaced pkgos_var_user_group nova by pkgos_adduser, as we don't want to
    create the log / lib dirs of nova (Closes: #709876).
  * Creates the correct libvirt group if the package is installed in Ubuntu.
  * Bumped Standard-Version to 3.9.4.
