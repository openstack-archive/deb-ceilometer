    The previous configuration options default for
    `requeue_sample_on_dispatcher_error' and
    `requeue_event_on_dispatcher_error' allowed to lose data very easily: if
    the dispatcher failed to send data to the backend (e.g. Gnocchi is down),
    then the dispatcher raised and the data were lost forever. This was
    completely unacceptable, and nobody should be able to configure Ceilometer
    in that way."

upgrade:
  - >
    The options `requeue_event_on_dispatcher_error' and
    `requeue_sample_on_dispatcher_error' have been enabled and removed.
