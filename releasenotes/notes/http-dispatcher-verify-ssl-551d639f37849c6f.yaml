features:
  - In the [dispatcher_http] section of ceilometer.conf, verify_ssl can be
    set to True to use system-installed certificates (default value) or
    False to ignore certificate verification (use in development only!).
    verify_ssl can also be set to the location of a certificate file
      e.g. /some/path/cert.crt (use for self-signed certs)
    or to a directory of certificates.
    The value is passed as the 'verify' option to the underlying requests
    method, which is documented at
    http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification
