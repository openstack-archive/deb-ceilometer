    [`bug 1536498 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1536498>`_]
    Patch to fix duplicate meter definitions causing duplicate samples.
    If a duplicate is found, log a warning and skip the meter definition.
    Note that the first occurrence of a meter will be used and any following
    duplicates will be skipped from processing.
