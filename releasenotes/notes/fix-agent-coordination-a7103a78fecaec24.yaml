    [`bug 1533787 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1533787>`_]
    Fix an issue where agents are not properly getting registered to group
    when multiple notification agents are deployed. This can result in
    bad transformation as the agents are not coordinated. It is still
    recommended to set heartbeat_timeout_threshold = 0 in
    [oslo_messaging_rabbit] section when deploying multiple agents.
