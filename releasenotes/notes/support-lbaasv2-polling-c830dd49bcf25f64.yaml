    Support for polling Neutron's LBaaS v2 API was added as v1 API in Neutron
    is deprecated. The same metrics are available between v1 and v2.
issues:
  - >
    Neutron API is not designed to be polled against. When polling against
    Neutron is enabled, Ceilometer's polling agents may generage a significant
    load against the Neutron API. It is recommended that a dedicated API be
    enabled for polling while Neutron's API is improved to handle polling.
upgrade:
  - >
    By default, Ceilometer will poll the v2 API. To poll legacy v1 API,
    add neutron_lbaas_version=v1 option to configuration file.
