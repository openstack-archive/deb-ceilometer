upgrade:
  - Batching is enabled by default now when coordinated workers are enabled.
    Depending on load, it is recommended to scale out the number of
    `pipeline_processing_queues` to improve distribution. `batch_size` should
    also be configured accordingly.
fixes:
  - Fix to improve handling messages in environments heavily backed up.
    Previously, notification handlers greedily grabbed messages from queues
    which could cause ordering issues. A fix was applied to sequentially
    process messages in a single thread to prevent ordering issues.
