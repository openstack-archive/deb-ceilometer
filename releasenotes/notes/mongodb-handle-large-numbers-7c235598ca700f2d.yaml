    [`bug 1532661 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1532661>`_]
    Fix statistics query failures due to large numbers stored in MongoDB. Data
    from MongoDB is returned as Int64 for big numbers when int and float types
    are expected. The data is cast to appropriate type to handle large data.
