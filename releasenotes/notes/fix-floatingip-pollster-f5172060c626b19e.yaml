      [`bug 1536338 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1536338>`_]
      Patch was added to fix the broken floatingip pollster
      that polled data from nova api, but since the nova api
      filtered the data by tenant, ceilometer was not getting
      any data back. The fix changes the pollster to use the
      neutron api instead to get the floating ip info.
