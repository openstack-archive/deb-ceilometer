    Ceilometer backends are no more only databases but
    also REST API like Gnocchi. So ceilometer-dbsync binary
    name doesn't make a lot of sense and have been renamed
    ceilometer-upgrade. The new binary handles database
    schema upgrade like ceilometer-dbsync does, but it
    also handle any changes needed in configured ceilometer
    backends like Gnocchi.
deprecations:
  - For backward compatibility reason we temporary
    keep ceilometer-dbsync, at least for one major version to
    ensure deployer have time update their tooling.
