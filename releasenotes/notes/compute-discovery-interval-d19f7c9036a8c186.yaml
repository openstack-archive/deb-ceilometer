    To minimise load on Nova API, an additional configuration option was added
    to control discovery interval vs metric polling interval. If
    resource_update_interval option is configured in compute section, the
    compute agent will discover new instances based on defined interval. The
    agent will continue to poll the discovered instances at the interval
    defined by pipeline.
