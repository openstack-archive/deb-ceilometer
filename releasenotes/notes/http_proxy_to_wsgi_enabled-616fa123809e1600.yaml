    - Ceilometer sets up the HTTPProxyToWSGI middleware in front of Ceilometer. The
      purpose of this middleware is to set up the request URL correctly in
      case there is a proxy (for instance, a loadbalancer such as HAProxy)
      in front of Ceilometer.
      So, for instance, when TLS connections are being terminated in the
      proxy, and one tries to get the versions from the / resource of
      Ceilometer, one will notice that the protocol is incorrect; It will show
      'http' instead of 'https'. So this middleware handles such cases.
      Thus helping Keystone discovery work correctly.
      The HTTPProxyToWSGI is off by default and needs to be enabled via a
      configuration value.
