 Measurements
==============

Three type of meters are defined in ceilometer:

.. index::
   double: meter; cumulative
   double: meter; gauge
   double: meter; delta

==========  ==============================================================================
Type        Definition
==========  ==============================================================================
Cumulative  Increasing over time (instance hours)
Gauge       Discrete items (floating IPs, image uploads) and fluctuating values (disk I/O)
Delta       Changing over time (bandwidth)
==========  ==============================================================================

Units
=====

1. Whenever a volume is to be measured, SI approved units and their
   approved symbols or abbreviations should be used. Information units
   should be expressed in bits ('b') or bytes ('B').
2. For a given meter, the units should NEVER, EVER be changed.
3. When the measurement does not represent a volume, the unit
   description should always described WHAT is measured (ie: apples,
   disk, routers, floating IPs, etc.).
4. When creating a new meter, if another meter exists measuring
   something similar, the same units and precision should be used.
5. Samples (aka "meters" or "counters") should always document their
   units in Ceilometer (API and Documentation) and new sampling code
   should not be merged without the appropriate documentation.

At present, most of the Nova meters will only work with libvirt front-end
hypervisors while test coverage was mostly done based on KVM. Contributors
are welcome to implement other virtualization backendsâ€™ meters or complete
the existing ones.

Dynamically retrieving the Meters via ceilometer client
=======================================================

To retrieve the available meters that can be queried given the actual
resource instances available, use the ``meter-list`` command:

::

    $ ceilometer meter-list -s openstack
    +------------+-------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------+
    | Name       | Type  | Resource ID                          | User ID | Project ID                       |
    +------------+-------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------+
    | image      | gauge | 09e84d97-8712-4dd2-bcce-45970b2430f7 |         | 57cf6d93688e4d39bf2fe3d3c03eb326 |


Naming convention
=================
If you plan on adding meters, please follow the convention bellow:

1. Always use '.' as separator and go from least to most discriminent word.
   For example, do not use ephemeral_disk_size but disk.ephemeral.size

2. When a part of the name is a variable, it should always be at the end and start with a ':'.
   For example do not use <type>.image but image:<type>, where type is your variable name.

3. If you have any hesitation, come and ask in #openstack-metering
