 Measurements
==============

Three type of meters are defined in ceilometer:

.. index::
   double: meter; cumulative
   double: meter; gauge
   double: meter; delta

==========  ==============================================================================
Type        Definition
==========  ==============================================================================
Cumulative  Increasing over time (instance hours)
Gauge       Discrete items (floating IPs, image uploads) and fluctuating values (disk I/O)
Delta       Changing over time (bandwidth)
==========  ==============================================================================

Units
=====

1. Whenever a volume is to be measured, SI approved units and their
   approved symbols or abbreviations should be used. Information units
   should be expressed in bits ('b') or bytes ('B').
2. For a given meter, the units should NEVER, EVER be changed.
3. When the measurement does not represent a volume, the unit
   description should always described WHAT is measured (ie: apples,
   disk, routers, floating IPs, etc.).
4. When creating a new meter, if another meter exists measuring
   something similar, the same units and precision should be used.
5. Meters and samples should always document their units in Ceilometer (API
   and Documentation) and new sampling code should not be merged without the
   appropriate documentation.

At present, most of the Nova meters will only work with libvirt front-end
hypervisors while test coverage was mostly done based on KVM. Contributors
are welcome to implement other virtualization backends' meters or complete
the existing ones.

===============================  ==========  ==========  ===========  ============  ==========================================

In order to use storage.objects.incoming.bytes and storage.outgoing.bytes, one must configure
Swift as described in :ref:`installing_manually`. Note that they may not be
updated right after an upload/download, since Swift takes some time to update
the container properties.

Dynamically retrieving the Meters via ceilometer client
=======================================================

To retrieve the available meters that can be queried given the actual
resource instances available, use the ``meter-list`` command:

::

    $ ceilometer meter-list -s openstack
    +------------+-------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------+
    | Name       | Type  | Resource ID                          | User ID | Project ID                       |
    +------------+-------+--------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------+
    | image      | gauge | 09e84d97-8712-4dd2-bcce-45970b2430f7 |         | 57cf6d93688e4d39bf2fe3d3c03eb326 |


Naming convention
=================
If you plan on adding meters, please follow the convention bellow:

1. Always use '.' as separator and go from least to most discriminant word.
   For example, do not use ephemeral_disk_size but disk.ephemeral.size

2. When a part of the name is a variable, it should always be at the end and start with a ':'.
   For example do not use <type>.image but image:<type>, where type is your variable name.

3. If you have any hesitation, come and ask in #openstack-ceilometer


User-defined sample metadata for Nova
=========================================

Users are allowed to add additional metadata to samples of nova meter.
These additional metadata are stored in 'resource_metadata.user_metadata.*' of the sample
To do so, users should add nova user metadata prefixed with 'metering.':

::
    $ nova boot --meta metering.custom_metadata=a_value my_vm

Note: The name of the metadata shouldn't exceed 256 characters otherwise it will be cut off.
Also, if it has '.', this will be replaced by a '_' in ceilometer.

User-defined sample metadata for Swift
==========================================
It's possible to add additional metadata to sample of Swift meter as well.
You might specify headers whose values will be stored in resource_metadata as
'resource_metadata.http_header_$name', where $name is a name of the header with
'-' replaced by '_'.

This is done using 'metadata_headers' option in middleware configuration,
refer to :ref:`installing_manually` for details.

For example, this could be used to distinguish external and internal users. You'd
have to implement a custom Swift middleware that sets a proper header and just add
it to metadata_headers.
