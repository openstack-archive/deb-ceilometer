 Customizing Ceilometer Deployment
===================================

Notifications queues
====================

.. index::
   double: customizing deployment; notifications queues; multiple topics

By default, Ceilometer consumes notifications on the messaging bus sent to
**topics** by using a queue/pool name that is identical to the
topic name. You shouldn't have different applications consuming messages from
this queue. If you want to also consume the topic notifications with a system
other than Ceilometer, you should configure a separate queue that listens for
the same messages.

Ceilometer allows multiple topics to be configured so that the polling agent can
send the same messages of notifications to other queues. Notification agents
also use **topics** to configure which queue to listen for. If
you use multiple topics, you should configure notification agent and polling
agent separately, otherwise Ceilometer collects duplicate samples.

By default, the ceilometer.conf file is as follows::

   [oslo_messaging_notifications]
   topics = notifications

To use multiple topics, you should give ceilometer-agent-notification and
ceilometer-polling services different ceilometer.conf files. The Ceilometer
configuration file ceilometer.conf is normally locate in the /etc/ceilometer
directory. Make changes according to your requirements which may look like
the following::

For notification agent using ceilometer-notification.conf, settings like::

   [oslo_messaging_notifications]
   topics = notifications,xxx

For polling agent using ceilometer-polling.conf, settings like::

   [oslo_messaging_notifications]
   topics = notifications,foo

.. note::

   notification_topics in ceilometer-notification.conf should only have one same
   topic in ceilometer-polling.conf

Doing this, it's easy to listen/receive data from multiple internal and external services.


Using multiple dispatchers
==========================

.. index::
   double: customizing deployment; multiple dispatchers

The Ceilometer collector allows multiple dispatchers to be configured so that
data can be easily sent to multiple internal and external systems. Dispatchers
are divided between ``event_dispatchers`` and ``meter_dispatchers`` which can
each be provided with their own set of receiving systems.

.. note::

  In Liberty and prior, the configuration option for all data was
  ``dispatcher`` but this was changed for the Mitaka release to break out
  separate destination systems by type of data.

By default, Ceilometer only saves event and meter data in a database. If you
want Ceilometer to send data to other systems, instead of or in addition to
the Ceilometer database, multiple dispatchers can be enabled by modifying the
Ceilometer configuration file.

Ceilometer ships multiple dispatchers currently. They are ``database``,
``file``, ``http`` and ``gnocchi`` dispatcher. As the names imply, database
dispatcher sends metering data to a database, file dispatcher logs meters into
a file, http dispatcher posts the meters onto a http target, gnocchi
dispatcher posts the meters onto Gnocchi_ backend. Each dispatcher can have
its own configuration parameters. Please see available configuration
parameters at the beginning of each dispatcher file.

.. _Gnocchi: http://gnocchi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basic.html

To check if any of the dispatchers is available in your system, you can
inspect the Ceilometer egg entry_points.txt file, you should normally see text
like the following::

   [ceilometer.dispatcher]
   database = ceilometer.dispatcher.database:DatabaseDispatcher
   file = ceilometer.dispatcher.file:FileDispatcher
   http = ceilometer.dispatcher.http:HttpDispatcher
   gnocchi = ceilometer.dispatcher.gnocchi:GnocchiDispatcher

To configure one or multiple dispatchers for Ceilometer, find the Ceilometer
configuration file ceilometer.conf which is normally located at /etc/ceilometer
directory and make changes accordingly. Your configuration file can be in a
different directory.

To use multiple dispatchers on a Ceilometer collector service, add multiple
dispatcher lines in ceilometer.conf file like the following::

   [DEFAULT]
   meter_dispatchers=database
   meter_dispatchers=file

If there is no dispatcher present, database dispatcher is used as the
default. If in some cases such as traffic tests, no dispatcher is needed,
one can configure the line without a dispatcher, like the following::

   event_dispatchers=

With the above configuration, no event dispatcher is used by the Ceilometer
collector service, all event data received by Ceilometer collector will be
dropped.

For Gnocchi dispatcher, the following configuration settings should be added::

    [DEFAULT]
    meter_dispatchers = gnocchi

    [dispatcher_gnocchi]
    archive_policy = low

The value specified for ``archive_policy`` should correspond to the name of an
``archive_policy`` configured within Gnocchi.

For Gnocchi dispatcher backed by Swift storage, the following additional
configuration settings should be added::

    [dispatcher_gnocchi]
    filter_project = gnocchi_swift
    filter_service_activity = True

.. note::
   If gnocchi dispatcher is enabled, Ceilometer api calls will return a 410 with
   an empty result. The Gnocchi Api should be used instead to access the data.

Efficient polling
=================

- There is an optional config called ``shuffle_time_before_polling_task``
  in ceilometer.conf. Enable this by setting an integer greater than zero to
  shuffle polling time for agents. This will add some random jitter to the time
  of sending requests to Nova or other components to avoid large number of
  requests in a short time period.
- There is an option to stream samples to minimise latency (at the
  expense of load) by setting ``batch_polled_samples`` to ``False`` in
  ceilometer.conf.
