 Installing Manually
=====================

Installing the Collector
========================

.. index::
   double: installing; collector

1. If you want to be able to retrieve image counters, you need to instruct
   Glance to send notifications to the bus by changing ``notifier_strategy``
   to ``rabbit`` or ``qpid`` in ``glance-api.conf`` and restarting the
   service.

2. In order to retrieve object store statistics, ceilometer needs
   access to swift with ``ResellerAdmin`` role. You should give this
   role to your ``os_username`` user for tenant ``os_tenant_name``:

   ::

     $ keystone role-create --name=ResellerAdmin
     +----------+----------------------------------+
     | Property |              Value               |
     +----------+----------------------------------+
     |    id    | 462fa46c13fd4798a95a3bfbe27b5e54 |
     |   name   |          ResellerAdmin           |
     +----------+----------------------------------+

     $ keystone user-role-add --tenant_id $SERVICE_TENANT \
                              --user_id $CEILOMETER_USER \
                              --role_id 462fa46c13fd4798a95a3bfbe27b5e54

   You'll also need to add the Ceilometer middleware to Swift to account for
   incoming and outgoing traffic, adding this lines to
   ``/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf``::

     [filter:ceilometer]
     use = egg:ceilometer#swift

   And adding ``ceilometer`` in the ``pipeline`` of that same file.

3. Install MongoDB.

   Follow the instructions to install the MongoDB_ package for your
   operating system, then start the service.

4. Clone the ceilometer git repository to the management server::

   $ cd /opt/stack
   $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer.git

5. As a user with ``root`` permissions or ``sudo`` privileges, run the
   ceilometer installer::

   $ cd ceilometer
   $ sudo python setup.py install

6. Copy the sample configuration files from the source tree
   to their final location.

   ::

      $ mkdir -p /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/*.json /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/*.yaml /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf.sample /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf

7. Edit ``/etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf``

   1. Configure RPC

      Set the RPC-related options correctly so ceilometer's daemons
      can communicate with each other and receive notifications from
      the other projects.

      In particular, look for the ``*_control_exchange`` options and
      make sure the names are correct. If you did not change the
      ``control_exchange`` settings for the other components, the
      defaults should be correct.

      .. note::

         Ceilometer makes extensive use of the messaging bus, but has
         not yet been tested with ZeroMQ. We recommend using Rabbit or
         qpid for now.

   2. Set the ``metering_secret`` value.

      Set the ``metering_secret`` value to a large, random, value. Use
      the same value in all ceilometer configuration files, on all
      nodes, so that messages passing between the nodes can be
      validated.

   Refer to :doc:`configuration` for details about any other options
   you might want to modify before starting the service.

8. Start the collector.

   ::

     $ ./bin/ceilometer-collector

   .. note:: 

      The default development configuration of the collector logs to
      stderr, so you may want to run this step using a screen session
      or other tool for maintaining a long-running program in the
      background.

Installing the Compute Agent
============================

.. index::
   double: installing; compute agent

.. note:: The compute agent must be installed on each nova compute node.

1. Configure nova.

   The ``nova`` compute service needs the following configuration to
   be set in ``nova.conf``::

      # nova-compute configuration for ceilometer
      instance_usage_audit=True
      instance_usage_audit_period=hour
      notification_driver=nova.openstack.common.notifier.rpc_notifier
      notification_driver=ceilometer.compute.nova_notifier

2. Clone the ceilometer git repository to the server::

   $ cd /opt/stack
   $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer.git

4. As a user with ``root`` permissions or ``sudo`` privileges, run the
   ceilometer installer::

   $ cd ceilometer
   $ sudo python setup.py install

5. Copy the sample configuration files from the source tree
   to their final location.

   ::

      $ mkdir -p /etc/ceilometer

      nodes, so that messages passing between the nodes can be
      validated.

   Refer to :doc:`configuration` for details about any other options
   you might want to modify before starting the service.

7. Start the agent.

   ::

     $ ./bin/ceilometer-agent-compute

   .. note::

      The default development configuration of the agent logs to
      stderr, so you may want to run this step using a screen session
      or other tool for maintaining a long-running program in the
      background.

Installing the Central Agent
============================

.. index::
   double: installing; agent

.. note::

   The central agent needs to be able to talk to keystone and any of
   the services being polled for updates.

1. Clone the ceilometer git repository to the server::

   $ cd /opt/stack
   $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer.git

2. As a user with ``root`` permissions or ``sudo`` privileges, run the
   ceilometer installer::

   $ cd ceilometer
   $ sudo python setup.py install

3. Copy the sample configuration files from the source tree
   to their final location.

   ::

      $ mkdir -p /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/*.json /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/*.yaml /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf.sample /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf

      nodes, so that messages passing between the nodes can be
      validated.

   Refer to :doc:`configuration` for details about any other options
   you might want to modify before starting the service.

5. Start the agent

   ::

    $ ./bin/ceilometer-agent-central


Installing the API Server
=========================

.. index::
   double: installing; API

.. note::
   The API server needs to be able to talk to keystone and ceilometer's
   database.

1. Clone the ceilometer git repository to the server::

   $ cd /opt/stack
   $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/ceilometer.git

2. As a user with ``root`` permissions or ``sudo`` privileges, run the
   ceilometer installer::

   $ cd ceilometer
   $ sudo python setup.py install

3. Copy the sample configuration files from the source tree
   to their final location.

   ::

      $ mkdir -p /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/*.json /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/*.yaml /etc/ceilometer
      $ cp etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf.sample /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf

         qpid for now.

   Refer to :doc:`configuration` for details about any other options
   you might want to modify before starting the service.

5. Start the API server.

   ::

    $ ./bin/ceilometer-api

.. note::

   The development version of the API server logs to stderr, so you
   may want to run this step using a screen session or other tool for
   maintaining a long-running program in the background.


Configuring keystone to work with API
=====================================

.. index::
   double: installing; configure keystone

.. note::
   The API server needs to be able to talk to keystone to authenticate.

1. Create a service for ceilometer in keystone::

   $ keystone service-create --name=ceilometer \
                             --type=metering \
                             --description="Ceilometer Service"

2. Create an endpoint in keystone for ceilometer::

   $ keystone endpoint-create --region RegionOne \
                              --service_id $CEILOMETER_SERVICE \
                              --publicurl "http://$SERVICE_HOST:8777/" \
                              --adminurl "http://$SERVICE_HOST:8777/" \
                              --internalurl "http://$SERVICE_HOST:8777/"

.. note::

   CEILOMETER_SERVICE is the id of the service created by the first command
   and SERVICE_HOST is the host where the Ceilometer API is running. The
   default port value for ceilometer API is 8777. If the port value
   has been customized, adjust accordingly.
