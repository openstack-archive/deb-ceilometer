 Installing Ceilometer
=======================

.. note::

  The ceilometer team has limited capacity to provide support for
  older versions of the project. Because the project graduated from
  incubation around the time of the grizzly release, that is the
  first version for which we will provide regular ongoing support
  following `the standard deprecation cycle for OpenStack
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/StableBranch>`__. The grizzly
  version of ceilometer cannot be installed on the same server
  with earlier versions of OpenStack because of conflicting package
  requirements, but is API compatible with the folsom release if
  installed separately.
