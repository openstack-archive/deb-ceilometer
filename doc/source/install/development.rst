===============================
 Installing development sandbox
===============================

Ceilometer has several daemons. The basic are: :term:`polling agent` running
either on the Nova compute node(s) or :term:`polling agent` running on the
central management node(s), :term:`collector`
and :term:`notification agent` running on the cloud's management node(s).
In a development environment created by devstack_, these services are
typically running on the same server. They do not have to be, though, so some
of the instructions below are duplicated. Skip the steps you have already done.

.. note::

   In fact, previously ceilometer had separated compute and central agents, and
   their support is implemented in devstack_ right now, not one agent variant.
   For now we do have deprecated cmd scripts emulating old compute/central
   behavior using namespaces option passed to polling agent, which will be
   maintained for a transitional period.

Configuring devstack
====================

.. index::
   double: installing; devstack

1. Download devstack_.

2. Create a ``local.conf`` file as input to devstack.

   .. note::

      ``local.conf`` replaces the former configuration file called ``localrc``.
      If you used localrc before, remove it to switch to using the new file.
      For further information see the `localrc description page
      <http://devstack.org/localrc.html>`_ or `devstack configuration
      <http://devstack.org/configuration.html>`_.

3. Ceilometer makes extensive use of the messaging bus, but has not
   yet been tested with ZeroMQ. We recommend using Rabbit for
   now. By default, RabbitMQ will be used by devstack.

4. The ceilometer services are not enabled by default, so they must be
   enabled in ``local.conf`` before running ``stack.sh``.

   This example ``local.conf`` file shows all of the settings required for
   ceilometer::

      [[local|localrc]]

      # Enable the ceilometer metering services
      enable_service ceilometer-acompute ceilometer-acentral ceilometer-anotification ceilometer-collector

      # Enable the ceilometer alarming services
      enable_service ceilometer-alarm-evaluator,ceilometer-alarm-notifier

      # Enable the ceilometer api services
      enable_service ceilometer-api

   The first group of daemons are necessary for core ceilometer functionality:
   polling, event listening, and data collection.

5. Nova does not generate the periodic notifications for all known
   instances by default. To enable these auditing events, set
   ``instance_usage_audit`` to true in the nova configuration file and restart
   the service.

6. Cinder does not generate notifications by default. To enable
   these auditing events, set the following in the cinder configuration file
   and restart the service::

      notification_driver=messagingv2
