 Areas to Contribute
=====================

The Ceilometer project maintains a list of things that need to be worked on at:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ceilometer/RoadMap but feel free to work on
something else.

Plugins
=======

Ceilometer's architecture is based heavily on the use of plugins to
make it easy to extend to collect new sorts of data or store them in
different databases.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`architecture`
   * :doc:`plugins`

Core
====

The core parts of ceilometer, not separated into a plugin, are fairly
simple but depend on code that is part of ``nova`` right now. One
project goal is to move the rest of those dependencies out of ``nova``
and into ``oslo``. Logging and RPC are already done, but
the service and manager base classes still need to move.

Testing
=======

The first version of ceilometer has extensive unit tests, but
has not seen much run-time in real environments. Setting up a copy of
ceilometer to monitor a real OpenStack installation or to perform some
load testing would be especially helpful.
