# NOTE(dhellmann): Ming is necessary to provide the Mongo-in-memory
# implementation of MongoDB. The original source for Ming is at
# http://sourceforge.net/project/merciless but there does not seem to
# be a way to point to a "zipball" of the latest HEAD there, and we
# need features present only in that version. I forked the project to
# github to make it easier to install, then ended up making some
# changes to it so it would be compatible with PyMongo's API.
