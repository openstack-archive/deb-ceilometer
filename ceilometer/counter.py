"""Counter class for holding data about a metering event.

A Counter doesn't really do anything, but we need a way to
ensure that all of the appropriate fields have been filled
in by the plugins that create them.

# Fields explanation:
#
# Name: the name of the counter, must be unique
# Type: the type of the counter, must be either:
#       - cumulative: the value is incremented and never reset to 0
#       - delta: the value is reset to 0 each time it is sent
#       - gauge: the value is an absolute value and is not a counter
# Unit: the unit of the counter
# Volume: the counter value
# User ID: the user ID
# Project ID: the project ID
# Resource ID: the resource ID
# Timestamp: when the counter has been read
# Resource metadata: various metadata
