    Pipeline describes a chain of handlers. The chain starts with
    tranformer and ends with one or more publishers.

    The first transformer in the chain gets counter from data collector, i.e.
    pollster or notification handler, takes some action like dropping,
    aggregation, changing field etc, then passes the updated counter
    to next step.

    The subsequent transformers, if any, handle the data similarly.

    In the end of the chain, publishers publish the data. The exact publishing
    method depends on publisher type, for example, pushing into data storage
    through message bus, sending to external CW software through CW API call.

    If no transformer is included in the chain, the publishers get counters
    from data collector and publish them directly.
